TyperSharkAI
============

I'm working on an AI that using only computer vision techniques and the ability to type as fast as me can beat Typer Shark.

Current Progress
============
On Expert difficulty, we can get past the first level, sometimes with all of our lives left but usually with no lives left. We die when we run into
the piranhas on the second level and only intermittently try to fight them. We don't try to do the bonus words at the end of the first level but
that is expected since I haven't coded anything to do that.

Dependencies
============
The python libraries or bindings for Numpy, Scipy, OpenCV, and the Python Imaging Library (PIL) must be installed.
If the Typer Shark program is not installed or you're not on a Windows platform, then line 48 needs to be changed.
