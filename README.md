TyperSharkAI
============

I'm working on an AI that using only computer vision techniques and the ability to type as fast as me can beat Typer Shark.

Dependencies
============
The python libraries or bindings for Numpy, Scipy, OpenCV, and the Python Imaging Library (PIL) must be installed.
If the Typer Shark program is not installed or you're not on a Windows platform, then line 48 needs to be changed.
